## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |f1 = 0.28KHZ|f1 = 0.24KHZ|
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency |f2 = 1.4MHZ|f2 = 2.7MHZ|
| 3 | Bandwidth | BW = 1.39MHZ | BW = 2.6MHZ |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain |AVMID = 21 |AVMID = 17.04 |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |G0 = 4.84  | G0 = 12.08 |
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
